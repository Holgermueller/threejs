# Alternate Earth Number Generator

## An app that allows users to come up with numerical disignations for parallel worlds.

This app is basically a random number generator with a twist; its primary use is to create numerical disignations for Earths that exist in other plains of reality. It allows users to set the length they'd like the designation to have, whether or not it contains alphabetical characters, and if it's a positive or negative number. Using this app gives users one less thing to fret over.

This app is also part of a series of apps I created to assist me with my passion for creating and writing stories. The other apps are:

- [Story Idea Generator, Mark 2](https://holgermueller.github.io/SIGMK2/)
- [The Sci-Fi Name Generator](https://holgermueller.github.io/sfnamegenerator/)
